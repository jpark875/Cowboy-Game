In this game, you play as a cowboy defending his home from waves of enemies. You can move the character using "WASD" keys and shoot by left-clicking your mouse. The fire rate of your weapon increases based on your proximity to the right side of the screen and the number of pineapples you collect, which spawn randomly. These fruits boost your fire rate, but getting closer to enemies for faster shooting also increases the risk to your health. You lose the game if you take two hits or if an enemy reaches your house.

Enemies spawn at regular intervals, gradually becoming tougher as the game progresses, requiring more bullets to kill. Cacti in the environment block your movement but have no other effect. The main goal is to survive and protect your house for as long as possible.
